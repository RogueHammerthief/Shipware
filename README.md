Shipware is a script that's run on the Programmable Block from the game Space Engineers. The script gathers information from blocks, passes orders to other blocks on the grid, and displays information on blocks with LCD screens. It uses INI-formatted configuration in each block's Custom Data to determine how it should do all of this.
The script's Steam Workshop page can be found here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2681807135
